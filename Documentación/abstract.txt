This Final Degree Project explores the integration of cybersecurity
mechanisms in video games developed with Unity and deployed on Amazon
Web Services (AWS) distributed infrastructures. The main objective is to
ensure data protection, fraud prevention, and secure player
authentication through cloud-based services. The proposed solution
includes strategies for license validation, score verification, and
progress synchronization, as well as cheat detection based on gameplay
metrics. Additional measures such as version control, temporary
authorization, and secure logging are also implemented to strengthen
application integrity.  

The backend is built on a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda,
DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, and CloudWatch, enabling scalable,
flexible, and secure performance according to system demands. This
project provides a practical framework that combines distributed
computing and information security to protect real-time multiplayer
experiences. The approach contributes to the development of resilient
gaming infrastructures, enhancing user trust and ensuring the
sustainability of online game systems.
